My personal portfolio website where I integrate a few of my other projects and discuss topics of interest.

This website was built with [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with the [radion](https://github.com/micahkepe/radion) theme. I have made a few edits to the templating and integrated
some other widgets with [htmx](https://htmx.org/).

## Deep Dive Architecture
For hosting this portfolio site, I chose Cloudflare. It is much more straightforward to deploy simple applications to Cloudflare and I like their free plan.
